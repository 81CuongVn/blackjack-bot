    To start a blackjack game in your channel use the 'blackjack <bet>' command,
    and instead of <bet> put the amount you want to gamble (the value must be an integer).
    After you start a blackjack game use 'hit' command to draw a new card, 'stand' command
    to hold your total and end your turn, 'double' command which is like a 'hit' command,
    but the bet is doubled and you only get one more card, or 'surrender' command to give
    up and lose your bet.
